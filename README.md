# SynapseVM-Distributed-Saliency-Aware-KV-Cache-Management
A research-oriented Distributed Virtual Memory System for LLMs. SynapseVM breaks the physical VRAM wall by dynamically tiering and quantizing the KV-Cache across heterogeneous memory (GPU HBM &lt;--> CPU RAM) based on real-time attention saliency.
